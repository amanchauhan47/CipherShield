# CipherShield
CipherShield
CipherShield is a project consisting of three programs for symmetric key encryption and decryption of messages.

Programs Overview
Key Generation Program

Generates a symmetric key each time it runs.
Saves the generated key into a file named symmetric_keys.txt.
Encryption Program

Takes a plaintext message and a symmetric key as inputs.
Encrypts the message using the provided key.
Outputs the encrypted ciphertext.
Decryption Program

Takes an encrypted ciphertext and the corresponding symmetric key as inputs.
Decrypts the ciphertext back to its original plaintext form.
Usage
Key Generation Program

Execute key_generation.py.
The generated symmetric key will be saved in symmetric_keys.txt.
Encryption Program

Run encryption.py.
Enter the plaintext message and provide the symmetric key when prompted.
The encrypted ciphertext will be displayed.
Decryption Program

Execute decryption.py.
Input the encrypted ciphertext and the corresponding symmetric key.
The decrypted plaintext message will be shown.
